    <h2>More About Motivated Mindset Dancers Studio</h2>

    <!-- Our Mission & Belief -->
    <div class="image-text-row">
      <img src="./images/mmds26.jpeg" alt="Children at MMDS">
      <div class="text">
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
          We help not because we're rich, but because we give from the little we have. If you have, it doesn't mean everyone has. Many people need your small help, and your contribution can make a big difference in supporting orphans and needy children at Motivated Mindset Dancers Studio.
        </p>
        <p>
          We support children and walk their journey with them, not because we have, but because of the challenging path they have walked. If you have been through tough times, you understand what these challenges can put young children through.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to ensure no child is left out of school, lacking resources or opportunities. Education is key to ending household poverty, and we continue walking this bumpy road until these amazing children shape their future through quality education.

    <!-- Feeding Program -->
    <div class="image-text-row reverse">
      <img src="./images/mmds16.jpeg" alt="Feeding children">
      <div class="text">
        <h3>Feeding Program</h3>
        <p>
          Many children in our community go without food. We kindly request your support to help feed the needy orphans. Together, we can give them hope, strength, and a brighter tomorrow.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
          Your contribution, no matter how small, can make a huge impact. #SupportTheOrphans #FeedTheHungry #GiveHope
        </div>
        <p>
          No child should have to choose between hunger and their dreams. Your support will directly help restore our street feeding program, which many dancers rely on for daily meals.
        </p>
      </div>

    <!-- Education Support -->
    <div class="image-text-row">
      <img src="./images/mmds25.jpeg" alt="Education support">
      <div class="text">
        <h3>Education & Sponsorship</h3>
        <p>
          We don’t support orphans out of sympathy — we support them out of belief in their dignity, strength, and future. Your sponsorship writes the next chapter of their lives. Education is key to ending household poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to appreciate our previous sponsors who used to fund our kids’ education before the cut-off. Your sacrifice was incredible, and your support continues to give hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every contribution helps secure a better future and allows children to thrive despite hardships.

    <!-- Single Mothers Community -->
    <div class="image-text-row reverse">
      <img src="./images/mmds20.jpeg" alt="Single moms support">
      <div class="text">
        <h3>Supporting Single Mothers</h3>
        <p>
          Inspired by online challenges and judgments, we started a sisterhood for single mothers — a safe space for conversations, support, and empowerment. Weekly meetups, love, laughter, and shared ideas help them raise their children single-handedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not all single mothers come with drama. Many are educated, independent, and raising the next generation of leaders. They're defined by their strength, resilience, and determination. They deserve respect and encouragement for their efforts.

        <h3>Unique Programs: Camping & Life Skills</h3>
        <p>
          MMDS is the only dance studio in Mathare slums that organizes camping experiences for children. They gain more than dance skills — mental health awareness, mentorship, leadership, creative training, and life skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite social media challenges, our mission is bigger than numbers — it’s about changing lives. We are calling for partnerships, collaborations, and donations to keep this safe, empowering space alive.

      <div class="text">
        <h3>Mental Health Advocacy</h3>
        <p>
          We advocate for mental health, fighting suicide thoughts and supporting children in crisis. Many learn to cope alone, but our mission is to provide guidance, resilience, and hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          Healing changes how children let people in — your support ensures no child is left unheard or unseen. May our dancers never die of depression.

        <h3>Urgent Support Needed</h3>
        <p>
