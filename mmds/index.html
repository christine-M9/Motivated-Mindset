      <h2>A Cry from the Heart of Mathare</h2>
      <p>
        Motivated Mindset Dancers Studio is more than a dance studio —
        it is a sanctuary. A place where children escape crime, poverty,
        and despair to rediscover hope, confidence, and belonging.
      </p>
      <p>
        Funding cuts threaten our survival, but every dance step remains
        an act of resilience, belief, and perseverance.
        We are seeking to raise USD 13,000 to ensure the sustainability of our program. These funds will help us clear outstanding rent arrears for our dance studio, support studio renovation, single mothers welfare, cover school fees for our dancers, provide food, events logistics  and purchase essential costumes. This support will enable us to continue operating safely and sustainably while nurturing talent and education this year.

      <h2>Founder’s Story</h2>
    </header>


    <div class="founder-story">
  <div class="story-block">
    <h4>Early Life & Displacement</h4>

    <p>
      My name is Brian Otieno Owino. I was born in Siaya County, Kenya, but poverty forced my parents
      to abandon everything familiar in search of survival.
      I was only three years old when we arrived in Mathare Slum—a place where hope struggles to breathe
      and childhood ends far too early.
      My father was a mechanic who worked until exhaustion, yet earned too little to send me to school.
      While other children carried books, I carried sacks of plastic and scrap metal. Hunger raised me.
      Tomorrow was never guaranteed.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="story-block">
    <h4>A Life-Changing Act of Kindness</h4>

    <p>
      Then—against all odds—someone saw me.
      Mrs. Paul Katherine Trepinski from the United States chose to believe in a street child from Mathare.
      She paid my school fees from Grade 1 through university and restored dignity when the world had taken it away.
      In 2015, during my final high school examinations, she passed away. Though she was gone,
      her love remained—my university education was fully funded through her will.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="story-block">
    <h4>Community, Sport & Belonging</h4>

    <p>
      Through the vision of the late Bob Munro, I was supported by the Mathare Youth Sports Association (MYSA).
      MYSA gave me school fees, books, and access to libraries—but more importantly, it gave me belonging.
      Football became my escape from poverty. Through sport, leadership, and dance,
      I earned scholarships that supported both me and my younger brother.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="story-block">
    <h4>Education & Service</h4>

    <p>
      Despite everything, I fought for education—studying ICT at Nairobi Polytechnic,
      Leadership at Born to Lead Academy, and Mindset Education at Mahanaim International School.
      For six years, I volunteered with the Kenya Scouts Association and later served as a youth mobilizer
      with Slumcode Group Organization, training children daily—free of charge.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="story-block">
    <h4>Giving Back During Crisis</h4>

    <p>
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, I used my ICT skills to support Blossoms Children Education Center
      by building their digital presence so they could survive.
      During this time, Hilary Crowley believed in my work and supported Motivated Mindset Dancers Studio.
      Even when funding ended, grace carried us forward.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="story-block highlight">
    <h4>Motivated Mindset Dancers Studio</h4>

    <p>
      Today, I run Motivated Mindset Dancers Studio—a safe space for children who are hungry,
      angry, and forgotten.
      Through dance, we offer discipline instead of drugs, hope instead of crime,
      and purpose instead of despair.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="story-block plea">
    <h4>Our Current Reality</h4>

    <p>
      Today, we are struggling. Studio rent is overdue. Bills are piling up.
      Calls go unanswered. Messages are left on read.
      Some nights, I sit alone in the studio and cry—not for myself,
      but for the children who call this place home.

      Funding History
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; line-height:1.8; color:#333; margin-bottom:30px;">
      Motivated Mindset Dancers Studio has previously relied on support from key sponsors to sustain its programs and community activities. Our main sponsor in past years was Hilary Crowley, alongside support from the Hip Hop Congress National Organization. However, due to the recent discontinuation of funding for programs in Africa, this support has come to an end. As a result, the studio is currently facing significant financial challenges and is struggling to sustain its operations due to a lack of funding.
